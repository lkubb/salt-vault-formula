    Make sure a database connection is present as specified.

    name
        The name of the database connection.

    plugin
        The name of the database plugin. Known plugins to this module are:
        ``cassandra``, ``couchbase``, ``elasticsearch``, ``influxdb``, ``hanadb``, ``mongodb``,
        ``mongodb_atlas``, ``mssql``, ``mysql``, ``oracle``, ``postgresql``, ``redis``,
        ``redis_elasticache``, ``redshift``, ``snowflake``.
        If you pass an unknown plugin, make sure its Vault-internal name can be formatted
        as ``{plugin}-database-plugin`` and to pass all required parameters as kwargs.

    version
        Specifies the semantic version of the plugin to use for this connection.

    verify
        Verify the connection during initial configuration. Defaults to True.

    allowed_roles
        List of the roles allowed to use this connection. ``["*"]`` means any role
        can use this connection. Defaults to empty (no role can use it).

    root_rotation_statements
        Specifies the database statements to be executed to rotate the root user's credentials.
        See the plugin's API page for more information on support and formatting for this parameter.

    password_policy
        The name of the password policy to use when generating passwords for this database.
        If not specified, this will use a default policy defined as:
        20 characters with at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, and 1 dash character.

    rotate
        Rotate the root credentials after plugin setup. Defaults to True.

    force
        When the plugin changes, this state fails to protect from accidental errors.
        Set force to True to delete existing connections with the same name and a
        different plugin type. Defaults to False.

    mount
        The mount path the database backend is mounted to. Defaults to ``database``.

    kwargs
        Different plugins require different parameters. You need to make sure that you pass them
        as supplemental keyword arguments. For known plugins, the required arguments will
        be checked.
